EE 595 HW 2 LoRa Real World Packet Decoding
Xinghua Sun

i. Your decoder design, model and components (add pictures if it 
helps)
    Preamble detection using [preamble netid(zeros) sync] -> 
    central frquency correction *exp(-1j*2*pi*cfo) -> 
    dechirping -> symbols
    gray decoding ->
    deinterleaving ->
    hamming correction if 4/7 or 4/8 ->
    dewhitening ->
    decoded bytes

ii. How did you compensate for CFO? Is there a cool new way you 
found?
    directly times *exp(-1j*2*pi*cfo)

iii. How does your code improve noise resilience?
    use the preamble and the sync at the same time. the netid is unknown so was set to zeros.

iv. How does your code deal with LDRO mode?
    the ldro basically was implemented in diag-interleaving where data of size [cp, sf-2*ldr] -> [sf-2*ldr, cp] 
    if LDRO is enabled then ldr = 1. The header always has ldro mode, the payload always does not have ldro mode.

v. Extra capabilities you implemented (optional, anything which was 
not specified)
